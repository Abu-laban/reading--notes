## An introduction to wireframing

1. What is a wireframe?

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code—**whether that’s a developer coding it, or you the designer**.

> Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

## HTML basics

HTML (**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing **angle brackets**. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2. **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

3. **The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

4. **The element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
