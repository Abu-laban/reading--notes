# The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately
> I sometimes say to myself :speech_balloon: “Self :man_technologist:, you need to embrace the growth mindset :brain:	. The growth mindset is :cool:	.”
 Why :question:
   **When we’re _growing_ :person_in_tuxedo: , we’re more _productive_ :milky_way: . And when I’m _productive_ :star2:, I feel better :superhero_man:	. And you can, too. :trophy:**

<p>

#### :pushpin:	 1. What was the best part of the day?

#### :pushpin:	 2. Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
  
#### :pushpin:	 3. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
