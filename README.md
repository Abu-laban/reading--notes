# The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately

> I sometimes say to myself 💬 “Self 👨‍💻, you need to embrace the growth mindset 🧠 . The growth mindset is 🆒😎 .”
> Why ❓
> **When we’re _growing_ 🤵 , we’re more _productive_ 🌌 . And when I’m _productive_ 🌟, I feel better 🦸‍♂️ . And you can, too. 🏆**

<details><summary> 📋	So I've learned to ask myself three questions:</summary>

<p>

📌 1. What was the best part of the day?
<br>
📌 2. Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
<br>
📌 3. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
<br>
